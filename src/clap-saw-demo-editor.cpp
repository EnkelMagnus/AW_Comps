 * values which are supported.
 *
 * The important thing from a VSTGUI perspective here is that we have to initialize
 * the VSTGUI static data structures. On Mac and Windows, this is an easy call and
 * we can use the VSTGUI::finally mechanism to clean up. On Linux there is a more
 * complicated global event loop to merge which, thanks to the way VSTGUI structures
 * their event loops, is a touch more awkward. As such the linux code is all in a different
 * cpp file for individual documentation (Please see the README for any linux disclaimers
 * and most recent status).
